<div class="content"><strong>Content Update 3.3.0 -- Path of Exile: Incursion</strong><br>
<ul></ul><br>
<strong>The Incursion Challenge League</strong><br>
<ul><li>Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!</li><li>With 3.3.0, there are Standard and Hardcore, and Solo Self-Found Standard and Hardcore, variations of the Incursion challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items.</li><li>In the Incursion Challenge League, explorer Alva Valai is searching for the ancient Vaal treasure temple of Atzoatl. Travel back in time to discover the location of the temple and change its history to maximise your reward.</li><li>Each time you encounter Alva in the wilderness, she can open a time portal, allowing you to visit the Temple of Atzoatl during its construction. Your brief visit can be extended by laying waste to its inhabitants. These visits allow Alva to learn its location in the present day, and allow you to influence its contents and reap its rewards.</li><li>After 11 Temporal Incursions, Alva will have narrowed down the present-day location of the Temple of Atzoatl. Together, you can explore the jungle, discover the temple and claim its treasures. Each type of room in the temple has its own unique risks and rewards.</li><li>Your actions in the past have significant consequences. By killing the Vaal Architects who guide the temple's construction, you can influence what rooms appear in the present-day version. During your Incursions, you may find keys that can be used to unlock doors in the past, allowing access to additional rooms in the future.</li><li>By traveling into the past and influencing the Vaal Architects to upgrade the rooms they are building, you can access even greater treasures. Many upgraded rooms come with rewards worthy of the significant danger they introduce into the temple.</li><li>The new challenge leagues include a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Incursion Bandana. At 24, you will receive the Incursion Cloak. When you complete your 36th challenge, you will receive the Incursion Portal Effect. These microtransactions are only obtainable in this league.</li><li>From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Incursion Totem Pole decoration to display in your hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Incursion challenges you completed during the league.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Major New Content and Features</strong><br>
<ul><li>Added a new Strength gem - Vaal Earthquake: Smash the ground, dealing damage in an area and cracking the earth. The crack will erupt in a powerful aftershock after a short delay. Your steps will deal damage around you for a duration, cracking the earth if the previous cracks have erupted.</li><li>Added a new Intelligence gem - Vaal Blight: Apply a powerful debuff which deals chaos damage over time to enemies around. Then apply two additional layers in a larger area, growing greatly in size each time. Enemies are also substantially hindered, slowing their movement for a shorter secondary duration.</li><li>Added a new Dexterity gem - Vaal Blade Vortex: Create an independently-moving vortex of ethereal blades which last for a duration. The vortex moves towards nearby enemies, repeatedly damaging enemies that it passes through.</li><li>Added a new Strength/Intelligence gem - Vaal Impurity of Fire: Casts an aura that reduces fire damage taken and provides ignite immunity to you and nearby allies, and makes hits against nearby enemies ignore their fire resistance.</li><li>Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Vaal Impurity of Ice: Casts an aura that reduces cold damage taken and provides freeze and chill immunity to you and nearby allies, and makes hits against nearby enemies ignore their cold resistance.</li><li>Added a new Intelligence gem - Vaal Impurity of Lightning: Casts an aura that reduces lightning damage taken and provides shock immunity to you and nearby allies, and makes hits against nearby enemies ignore their lightning resistance.</li><li>Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Charged Traps Support: Supported trap skills have a chance to gain frenzy and power charges when your traps are triggered by an enemy. Also grants increased trap throwing speed per frenzy charge and added critical strike multiplier for traps per power charge.</li><li>Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Flamethrower Trap: Throw a trap that releases a number of flames in different directions around it when triggered. The flames last for a duration, rotating around the trap and repeatedly dealing damage. Burning enemies are dealt more damage.</li><li>Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Seismic Trap: Throw a trap which, once triggered, repeatedly releases a number of waves for a duration. Each wave deals damage in a series of small bursts in a line, ending with a larger burst. Modifiers to cast speed affect how frequently it releases waves.</li><li>Added a new Dexterity/Intelligence gem - Explosive Trap: Throw a trap that creates a large explosion when triggered, dealing spell damage in an area. A number of smaller explosions occur around this area in quick succession after the first.</li><li>Added a new Intelligence/Dexterity gem - Siphoning Trap: Throw a trap that applies debuff beams to a number of nearby enemies for a duration. The beams chill and deal cold damage over time. A beam is also applied to you, granting life and mana regeneration based on the number of debuff beams affecting enemies.</li><li>Added a new Intelligence/Dexterity gem - Lightning Spire Trap: Throw a trap which, once triggered, will repeatedly strike multiple areas around it for a duration, dealing lightning damage. Modifiers to cast speed affects how frequently it strikes. Has a higher chance to critically strike shocked enemies.</li><li>Added 31 new unique items, 4 of which were designed by our supporters.</li><li>Added 2 new Rogue Exiles, based on submissions by competition winners.</li><li>Added 22 new Divination Cards.</li><li>Added new corrupted implicits which can appear on items corrupted by Vaal orbs, bringing the total to approximately 176. Many of the old implicits were buffed or moved to different items, and some were disabled. Generally, corrupted implicits are now more powerful on average.</li><li>Added a new feature - Always Attack Without Moving: This feature prevents your character from moving while using skills where this is toggled on, as if you are holding down your "Attack in Place" key. This can be toggled on and off of individual skills in the skill bar. This feature can also be used on movement skills to prevent the skill from "namelocking" (ie. locking onto an enemy).</li></ul><br>
<strong>Minor New Content and Features</strong><br>
<ul><li>Added 39 new Labyrinth Enchantments for existing skills, and 43 for new skills. Enchantments for existing skills which have undergone significant reworking may not appear any more due to mechanical changes making them nonfunctional, such as enchantments which modify the cooldown of trap skills. Existing versions of these enchantments will now grant increased damage with that skill at the same value.</li><li>Added 6 dangerous new Nemesis mods.</li><li>Added 8 new Grandmasters to the Hall of Grandmasters unique map, and replaced 2 existing ones.</li><li>Added 3D art for the following unique items: Ambu's Charge, Apep's Rage, Bloodseeker, Chin Sol, Cloak of Tawm'r Isley, Cospri's Malice, Cospri's Will, Darkray Vectors, Death's Hand, Doomfletch, Doomsower, Doon Cuebiyari, Dreamfeather, Dying Breath, Empire's Grasp, Great Old One's Ward, Greed's Embrace, Haemophilia, Ichimonji, Infernal Mantle, Infractem, Innsbury Edge, Kingsguard, Kondo's Pride, Kongor's Undying Rage, Maligaro's Lens, Maloney's Nightfall, Mon'tregul's Grasp, Moonsorrow, Nomic's Storm, Null's Inclination, Pillar of the Caged God, Piscator's Vigil, Queen of the Forest, Reaper's Pursuit, Repentance, Sentari's Answer, Shackles of the Wretched, Sin Trek, Snakebite, Soul Mantle, Terminus Est, The Baron, The Beast Fur Shawl, The Broken Crown, The Goddess Bound, The Restless Ward, Veil of the Night, Victario's Charity, Voltaxic Rift, Wyrmsign</li><li>Updated the 2D and 3D art of Tabula Rasa to look less like a sweatshirt your grandmother gave you that was several sizes too large.</li><li>Updated the appearance of the totems found in the Beast areas in Acts 4 and 9.</li><li>Targets for the Pale Council Prophecy chains now show up on the minimap.</li><li>Ground effects of all types (such as chilled ground) have been updated. They should be clearer to see and better for performance.</li><li>Made several skill performance optimisations, most notably Molten Strike's performance at high projectile volumes.</li><li>World and Map areas can now have multiple sub-areas. This means you can now, for example, find a Zana mission in the same map as a Labyrinth trial, Abyssal Depths, or an Elder Guardian. Please note that only the most recently opened sub-area of any given area will stay open indefinitely, and others will eventually expire as if it were any other inactive instance. Expired sub-areas become inaccessible, rather than simply resetting.</li><li>The item filter now supports sorting by gem levels, stack sizes and explicit item mods.</li><li>You can now filter the social panel with Ctrl+F.</li><li>Updated the Loreweave, Kingmaker, and The Taming vendor recipes to give Shaper and Elder results if all the inputs were Shaper or Elder items. Elder/Shaper Breach items now also maintain their status if they are transformed with a Blessing.</li><li>Continued to incrementally improve the sound, art, effects and environments.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Character Balance</strong><br>
<ul><li>Modifiers to skill duration no longer modify the duration of traps, totems or mines, but will continue to modify the duration of skills cast by traps, totems and mines if those skills have a duration. </li><li>Ignite now deals 50% of the igniting hit's damage per second over 4 seconds (up from 40% per second).</li><li>You can now have up to 15 traps active at a time (up from 3).</li></ul><br>
<strong>Skill Balance</strong><ul><li>Supports which cause skills to create traps, totems or mines will no longer grant that skill the duration tag.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Traps</strong><ul><li>The interaction between trap skills with cooldowns and sources of additional traps thrown (such as the Multiple Traps or Cluster Trap Supports) has been changed, and now work as they did with Vaal Lightning Trap previously. Namely, additional traps can only be thrown if the skill has at least one extra trap cooldown stockpiled, and only as many additional traps will be thrown as there are cooldowns stockpiled. In other words, if you have three Seismic Traps stockpiled and have the Shaper's additional trap glove mod, you'll throw two traps and consume two Seismic Trap cooldowns. If you only have two cooldowns stockpiled and attempt to throw three Seismic Traps via the Multitrap support, you will only throw two traps.</li><li>As a result of this change to trap cooldowns, the following trap skills no longer have a cooldown: Fire Trap, Lightning Trap, Ice Trap.</li><li>The trap model has been updated.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Fire Trap</strong><ul><li>No longer has a cooldown.</li><li>Now requires level 12.</li><li>Now deals 7-11 fire damage when triggered at gem level 1 (up from 2-4), up to 410-616 at gem level 20.</li><li>The burning ground it creates now deals 24.1 fire damage per second at gem level 1 (up from 3.6), up to 1362.8 fire damage per second at gem level 20 (up from 701.2). This damage is now modified by spell damage modifiers.</li><li>Base duration of the burning ground is now 1.75 seconds (down from 8 seconds).</li><li>Now has 1% increased fire damage per 1% gem quality (previously had 3% increased burning damage per 2% gem quality).</li><li>Now deals added fire damage against burning enemies.</li><li>Now has an added damage effectiveness of 200% (up from 100%).</li></ul><br>
<strong>Bear Trap</strong><ul><li>Now applies a debuff on the affected enemy. The debuff lingers for a duration after the immobilising effects wear off.  While debuffed, enemies take 15% increased damage from traps and mines, and have 80% less movement speed. This movement speed gradually recovers back to normal over the course of the debuff's duration.</li><li>Now has a 4 second cooldown (up from 3).</li><li>Mana cost has been lowered at all levels. Now costs 6 mana at gem level 1 (down from 11), up to 23 mana at gem level 20 (down from 46)</li><li>Now has a base critical strike chance of 6% (up from 5%).</li></ul><br>

<strong>Ice Trap</strong><ul><li>No longer has a cooldown.</li><li>Now deals 48 -72 cold damage at gem level 1 (from 60-90), up to 414-620 at gem level 20 (from 519-778).</li><li>Now has a lower mana cost at higher gem levels, up to 22 mana at gem level 20 (from 25).</li></ul><br>
<strong>Conversion Trap</strong><ul><li>Trap duration lowered to 4 seconds (from 8).</li><li>Mana cost has been lowered at all levels. Now costs 6 mana at gem level 1 (down from 16), up to 23 mana at gem level 20 (down from 37)</li></ul><br>

<strong>Passive Tree Balance</strong><br>
<ul><li>There were two primary goals with the passive tree adjustments: Provide more power to ignite builds without providing more power to other burning damage builds, and rebalance trap and mine passives. To that end, most of the reductions to trap and mine passives occur to trap throwing speed and mine placement speed. This was to bring them more closely in line with cast speed. Trap cooldown recovery was also targeted, as many bread-and-butter traps no longer have cooldowns, and the traps introduced in this patch are strong enough to warrant their longer cooldowns.</li><li>To better enable trap builds from level 1, the Shadow's starting area has received numerous changes.</li><li>The first two passives of the Shadow's top starting path now both grant increased damage (rather than increased elemental damage).</li><li>The top passives of the Shadow's starting top cluster now grant increased trap and mine damage (rather than increased cast speed).</li><li>The bottom passives of the Shadow's starting bottom cluster now grant increased cast speed as well as attack speed.</li><li>Trickery (near the Shadow's start) now grants increased damage (rather than increased elemental damage).</li><li>The Saboteur cluster (near the Shadow) has moved even closer to the Shadow.

One grants +15% to trap and mine critical strike multiplier, the other grants 20% increased critical strike chance with traps and mines.</li><li>The Master Sapper cluster (previously near the Ranger) has been moved between the Ranger and the Shadow. It now has 4 passives (down from 6), and grants a total of 68% increased trap damage (down from 92%), 4% increased trap throwing speed (down from 12%), and 20% increased trap trigger area of effect (down from 40%).</li><li>The Expeditious Munitions cluster has moved where Saboteur used to be.

The two passives leading to the notable now each grant 4% increased trap throwing speed (down from 6%).</li><li>Hasty Reconstruction (between the Witch and Shadow) now grants 10% increased cooldown recovery speed for throwing traps (down from 20%) and the passive immediately before it now grants 5% increased cooldown recovery speed for throwing traps (down from 10%).</li><li>Celestial Judgement's (near the Templar) elemental resistance penetrations are now 5% (up from 2%).</li><li>Heart of Flame (near the Witch) now causes damage to penetrate 6% fire resistance (up from 3%). The passives leading to it now grant a total of 57% increased fire damage (up from 46%).</li><li>Breath of Flames (right next to Heart of Flame) now grants 20% increased ignite duration (up from 10%), 20% increased burning damage (down from 30%), 20% chance to ignite (up from 5%) and 20% increased fire damage (up from not giving any at all). The three passives leading to it now give a total of 20% increased burning damage (down from 40%), and 30% increased fire damage (previously none).</li><li>Heart of Thunder (also near the Witch) now causes damage to penetrate 6% lightning resistance (up from 3%). The passives leading to it now grant a total of 57% increased lightning damage (up from 48%).</li><li>Breath of Lightning (next to Heart of Thunder) now grants 20% increased lightning damage (up from 12%). The three passives leading to it now each grant 10% increased lightning damage (up from 8%).</li><li>Heart of Ice (guess where!) now causes damage to penetrate 6% cold resistance (up from 3%). The passives leading to it now grant a total of 57% increased cold damage (up from 48%).</li><li>Breath of Rime (Near the Duelist. Kidding! It's next to Heart of Ice) now grants 20% increased cold damage (up from 12%). The three passives leading to it now each grant 10% increased cold damage (up from 8%).</li><li>Holy Fire (between the Witch and Templar) now grants 40% increased burning damage (down from 60%), 20% increased fire damage (previously none), and 15% chance to ignite (previously none). The passives leading to it which previously granted 20% increased burning damage now grant 12% increased burning damage and 8% increased fire damage. The passive next to Holy Fire which grants 5% chance to ignite now also grants 8% increased fire damage.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Ascendancy Balance</strong><br>
<ul><li>The Elementalist's Beacon of Ruin now proliferates elemental ailments in a radius of 18 (up from 12). It no longer grants 20% increased effect of non-damaging ailments, and instead grants 20% more damage with ignite.</li><li>Each of the Saboteur's passives which previously granted increased elemental damage now grant increased trap and mine damage instead.</li><li>Each of the Saboteur's small passives which previously granted 8% increased trap throwing speed now grant 5% increased trap throwing speed.</li><li>Each of the Saboteur's small passives which previously granted 8% increased mine laying speed now grant 5% increased mine laying speed.</li><li>The Saboteur's Perfect Crime now grants 10% increased cooldown recovery speed for throwing traps (down from 20%).</li><li>The Saboteur's Chain Reaction now grants 15% increased cooldown recovery speed for throwing traps (down from 30%).</li></ul><br>
<strong>Item Balance</strong><br>
<ul><li>The Merciless and Eternal Labyrinth Arc enchantments that grant additional chains now grants +1 to chain from the Merciless Labyrinth (down from 2) and +2 chains in the Eternal Labyrinth (down from +3). Existing enchantments won't change unless a Blessed Orb is used, so don't do that.</li><li>The Merciless and Eternal Labyrinth Bear Trap enchantments that grant increased cooldown recovery speed now grant half as much.

<strong>Unique Item Balance</strong><br>
<ul><li>The following items have had their global accuracy modifiers replaced with local accuracy modifiers. Only builds which were dual-wielding any pair of these items will be affected. The affected items are: Rigwald's Command, Piscator's Vigil, Silverbranch, Silverbough, Quill Rain, Dreamfeather, Izaro's Dilemma, Rigwald's Charge, Kaom's Primacy, Marohi Erqi, Infractem, and Wideswing.</li><li>The Writhing Jar: Worms spawned from The Writhing Jar are now destroyed when hit. This overrides effects which would otherwise prevent them from dying, such as the one found on the unique gloves Southbound.</li><li>Stormfire: The "increased Burning Damage for each Enemy you have Shocked Recently" mod now only applies to enemies that were not already shocked. The description has been updated to clarify this.</li><li>Dyadus: No longer has the mod "Enemies chilled by you take 100% increased burning damage". Dyadus now has "100% increased Damage with Ignites inflicted on Chilled Enemies".</li><li>Rapid Expansion: Now limited to 2. With at least 40 Strength in Radius, it now grants Ground Slam a 35% chance to grant an Endurance Charge when you Stun an Enemy (up from 25%), and a 50% increased angle (up from 35%). Existing versions of this jewel can be updated with a Divine Orb.</li><li>Malachai's Artifice: Now correctly has 25% reduced effect of Elemental Equilibrium.

<strong>Monster Balance</strong><br>
<ul><li>Added two new monster types to the Control Blocks in Act 10, as well as to maps. Several existing Kitava-themed monsters have also been added to maps.</li><li>Monsters which use Detonate Dead and Vaal Detonate Dead have been updated to use a version similar to the one used by Alira and Tolman in maps. </li><li>Shivershell now telegraphs that he will use his Detonate Dead skill before he uses it.</li><li>All versions of Alira now have a shorter cast time for her Detonate Dead.</li><li>Normal and Magic monsters from Breaches now drop significantly fewer items.</li><li>The boss of Thicket, The Primal One, no longer has a cooldown on his sunder when he enrages.</li><li>Several monsters which raised zombies were incorrectly using the player version of the skill, resulting in very strong zombies capable of slamming.

<strong>Map Balance</strong><br>
<ul><li>Once you have completed 20 maps while the Elder and its guardians are on your atlas without actually defeating any of them, there is a chance for the Elder and its guardians to disappear and remove the Elder-influence from the maps they were on. This will make it difficult to maintain an "Elder Ring", but will also allow players who weren't capable of defeating the Elder or its guardians to clear them from their atlas.</li><li>Shaper memory fragments XI through to XV no longer require you to defeat the Elder or its guardians in specific map tiers. Instead, defeating each guardian and the elder within ANY red-tier map will get you one of these fragments.</li><li>You can no longer get Shaper memory fragments XI through to XV from a map if you are not the map's owner.</li><li>Zana's Onslaught mod now also increases monster movement speed. Previously, this was not the case.</li><li>Pit of the Chimera is now more linear.
