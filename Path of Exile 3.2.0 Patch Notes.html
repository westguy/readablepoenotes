<strong>The Bestiary Challenge League</strong><hr><ul><li>Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!</li><li>With 3.2.0, there are Standard and Hardcore, and Solo Self-Found Standard and Hardcore, variations of the Bestiary challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items.</li><li>Path of Exile: Bestiary lets you hunt and capture hundreds of deadly beasts across Wraeclast and then craft valuable new items with the help of the NPC Einhar Frey.</li><li>To capture a monster, highlight it and press V to throw a net. If the capture fails, the beast will enrage and become more dangerous. The lower life a beast has, the easier it is to capture.</li><li>Nets can be found in the world or purchased from Einhar. Better nets make capturing harder beasts easier.</li><li>Once captured, each beast is tracked in your very own Bestiary, a tome full of information and pictures.</li><li>Each captured beast is kept in your Menagerie, which you can visit by talking to Einhar once enough beasts have been captured.</li><li>You can use the Blood Altar in your Menagerie to perform Beastcrafting: sacrificing your captured beasts in combat to create and augment items. There are some very strong Beastcrafting recipes available, so we recommend capturing most rare beasts that you encounter.</li><li>You can also hunt four elusive Spirit Beasts, who drop pieces of four new unique item sets. If you somehow manage to capture one, these Spirit Beasts can be used in Beastcrafting.</li><li>The new challenge leagues include a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Bestiary Helmet. At 24, you will receive the Bestiary Wings. When you complete your 36th challenge, you will receive the Bestiary Portal Effect. These microtransactions are only obtainable in this league.</li><li>From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Bestiary Totem Pole decoration to display in your hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Bestiary challenges you completed during the league.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Major New Content and Features</strong><hr><ul><li>Added 2 new Active Skill Gems and 1 new Support Gem:</li><li>Added a new Dexterity/Strength Skill Gem - Spectral Shield Throw: Throws a spectral copy of your shield as a projectile which cannot pierce, and deals off-hand damage augmented by the defences of the shield. When it collides with something it will shatter, launching a number of smaller shards as projectiles in all directions. Modifiers that cause additional projectiles to be fired will add more shards, not more copies of the shield.</li><li>Added a new Strength Skill Gem - Tectonic Slam: Slam the ground with your weapon, unleashing a fiery fissure in front of you, dealing area damage and releasing a random number of smaller fissures branching off from it. If you have Endurance Charges, one will be consumed, maximising the number of fissures. Requires a Mace, Sword, Axe, Staff, or Unarmed.</li><li>Added a new Support Gem - Summon Phantasm on Kill: Causes supported skills or minions created by supported skills to summon a Phantasm minion on landing a killing blow.</li><li>Added Abyss to the core game. For information on changes made to the Abysses and related features, see the Abyss section below.</li><li>Introduced the final Elder encounter. This endgame encounter is the single most difficult challenge Path of Exile currently has to offer. Good luck!</li><li>Added the Elder Orb, obtainable after collecting all of the Shaper's Memory Fragments. The Elder Orb can upgrade any map on your Atlas to Tier 16.</li><li>Added 27 new unique items, 16 of which are exclusive to the Bestiary Challenge League.</li><li>Added 27 new Fated Unique prophecies.</li><li>Added a new quest - Vilenta's Vengeance: Vilenta has sided with Kitava and must be dealt with. Seek her out in Act Ten, and defeat her for a skill point. Existing characters who have completed the prerequisite quest (Map to Tsoatha) will already have the skill point and can instead collect the new reward for the Tear of Tsoatha quest.</li><li>Added a new Act Ten area: The Control Blocks. Could this be where Vilenta has been hiding out this whole time?</li><li>Added 10 new Divination Cards designed by our supporters.</li><li>Enabled that Rogue Exile we said we added last time, but this time we really mean it. Or do we...?</li><li>Added two-ish new vendor recipes.</li><li>Added 6 new Grandmasters and updated or replaced 5 others.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Minor New Content and Features</strong><hr><ul><li>The Witch can now select Lesser Poison Support as a quest reward upon reaching Lioneye's Watch.</li><li>The Shadow is no longer offered Lesser Poison Support as a quest reward for reaching Lioneye's Watch (since he should already have it), and is offered Elemental Proliferation instead.</li><li>Unique items dropped by bosses in special areas such as the Apex of Sacrifice, the Shaper's Realm, and Breach Domains are now allocated to the area's creator. This also applies to Blessings dropped by Breachlords.</li><li>Added 3D art for Debeon's Dirge.</li><li>Characters deleted during an event (such as a race) are no longer removed from the ladder and can still be awarded prizes.</li><li>Made improvements to Zana's Atlas questline - in particular to the sequences featuring the Shaper and Elder.</li><li>Completing Zana's Atlas quests now grants Zana Experience. It's easier to reach level 8 with her now.</li><li>When you use your Stash, the in-game chest now opens. It's like you're really there!</li><li>The patcher now does significantly fewer writes during the "Allocating Space" part of the patching process.</li><li>Updated several vendor recipes to now output Shaped or Elder items if all the input items were also Shaped or Elder.</li><li>Improved Achievement-checking functionality in cases where the Achievement server can't be reached.</li><li>Streamlined Zana's 'Take Shaper's Orb' dialogue options. Now the one option handles all available orbs.</li><li>Added support for using Harbinger's Orbs and Horizon Orbs on the most recent map series.</li><li>Improved the appearance of metal throughout the game.</li><li>More skills can now burn the grass.</li><li>The Purifier has received new skill effects for its sword-creating projectile skills.</li><li>Glacial Cascade's effect now fades out, rather than popping out.</li><li>The Dancing Dervish now carries across any cosmetic affects applied to it when it is Manifested.</li><li>Players with accounts created through Steam can now associate an email address to the account through the Path of Exile website. To do this, go to Manage Account, and then Change Email.</li><li>Slightly improved performance in the Hall of Grandmasters.</li><li>Improved the visibility on the Atlas of uncompleted maps that are under the Elder's influence.</li><li>The Map Device in the Templar Laboratory now has an awesome new effect.</li><li>Many story glyphs (such as Malachai's letter to Shavronne in The Warden's Chambers) have had their visuals updated to be slightly more eye-catching.</li><li>DPS calculations now take whether or not a particular weapon will actually be used (such as when dual-wielding two different weapon types, one of which cannot be used by the skill you are using) into consideration. This doesn't change your actual damage at all, but does now provide a more accurate tooltip.</li><li>Improved the way Sire of Shards works with weapon effects.</li><li>Storm Barrier now clearly states that it does not support Minion skills. </li><li>Added new Help Panel pages.</li><li>Continued to incrementally improve the sound, art, effects and environments.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Abyss Changes</strong><hr><ul><li>Abyss has been rolled into the core game! You can now encounter Abysses in the world from Part II onwards. Each area has approximately a 10% chance to spawn an Abyss.</li><li>Abyssal Depths can no longer appear in areas below level 70.</li><li>Stygian Vice belts can now only be found by completing an Abyssal Depths area.</li><li>The various Abyss Jewel basetypes can now only be found from Hoards in the Abyssal Depths and Abyss Troves from completing an Abyss. You are less likely to find rare Abyss jewels.</li><li>A new Sextant mod has been added which grants an additional Abyss.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Character Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>Player traps now explode at the end of their duration, triggering their skills. The exceptions to this are Bear Trap and Conversion Trap, which still break at the end of their duration.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Skill Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>The following Trap skills have had their base duration lowered to 4 seconds (from 16): Fire Trap, Ice Trap, Lightning Trap, Vaal Lightning Trap, Trap Support. Each of these traps will now trigger at the end of its duration.</li><li>The following Trap skills have had their base duration lowered to 8 seconds (from 16): Bear Trap, Conversion Trap.</li><li>Minion damage has been adjusted, and all minion types (except Raging Spirits) will now attack more quickly, but deal less base damage. This also fixes a long-standing issue where added damage would only apply in-part to most minions, so many minions will also get up to 50% more damage from sources of added damage. Sources of increased attack speed for your minions will now be correctly multiplicative with their base attack speed.</li><li>The Slam skill used by Raised Zombies can no longer be evaded.</li><li>Volley and Projectiles Nova now interact by creating projectile sources to either side of the player based on the number of projectiles, dividing those projectiles among those sources, and then each of those sources firing their projectiles in a nova.</li><li>Shrapnel Shot now converts 50% of Physical Damage to Lightning Damage (up from 40%).</li><li>Herald of Ash now also provides more Spell Fire Damage, and can trigger the overkill burn from spells.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Item Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>Many Divination Cards have had their drop weightings and locations adjusted. You should now find a better variety of cards throughout areas introduced in The Fall of Oriath. Some maps which had several high-value cards have had some of those cards moved elsewhere.</li><li>The Dying Anguish Divination Card can no longer reward gems with a maximum level lower than 20 or Vaal gems.</li><li>Skill gems which previously had the "Cast" tag now have the "Spell" tag. Skills which are spells but do not benefit from increases to spell damage now explicitly say so in the skill description. This has no impact on gameplay.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Unique Item Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>The Strange Barrel unique strongbox encounter has been reworked. It still doesn't contain swarms of things, but if it did, those swarms would spawn more quickly.</li><li>Shroud of the Lightless can no longer drop with 2 Abyssal sockets. </li><li>Projectiles from the Lightpoacher helmet's triggered skill Spirit Burst no longer always pierce. They travel 50% slower, which also affects the distance they travel. Their damage has been reduced by 25%. This affects all versions of Lightpoacher.</li><li>Zerphi's Last Breath now recovers life over 4 seconds instead of instantly. It now heals you for 450-600% of the mana cost, down from 800%. Divining existing versions of Zerphi's Last Breath will set it to these values.</li><li>Bisco's Collar now grants 35 to 50% increased Quantity of Items found from Slain Normal Enemies, down from 50 to 100%.</li><li>Doryani's Fist now clarifies that the added lightning damage specifically applies to Unarmed attacks (any attack with a hand that is not holding an item.) This means it will not apply to Spectral Shield Throw, as that skill uses a hand that has to be holding a shield.</li><li>Oni-Goroshi's drop chance has been adjusted. And by 'adjusted', we mean lowered. A lot.</li><li>Sunblast no longer causes traps to trigger when they expire, as that is now a base property of (almost) all traps.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Monster Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>The Damage increase from a monster's rarity (Magic, Unique etc) has been made multiplicative with other Damage modifiers. This means, for example, that a map mod that increases a boss's damage will be significantly more noticeable. Most but not all sources of increased damage (such as specific monster or map mods) have had their values adjusted to compensate. Be careful when fighting unique monsters, especially in mod-heavy maps.</li><li>The following monsters are no longer immune to Taunt, though they may not retarget based on being taunted. This is primarily to enable new Ascendancy passive skills in the Champion Ascendancy: The Shaper, The Elder, Guardian of the Phoenix, Guardian of the Minotaur, Guardian of the Hydra, Guardian of the Chimera, The Eradicator, The Enslaver, The Purifier and The Constrictor.</li><li>Maligaro and his Map equivalents, as well as Alira's map equivalents, now use a new version of Detonate Dead which explodes all corpses in an area after a delay.</li><li>Avarius, Reassembled now has 20% more Life.</li><li>The Oni-Goroshi version of Hillock has more life, deals more damage, and has learned a new trick.</li><li>Female ghosts have been seen roaming the haunted halls of Oriath alongside their male counterparts. The damage and attack speed of the male ghosts has been adjusted.</li><li>Daresso's spinning swords now play an effect when they appear and disappear, making it easier to see them.</li><li>Kitava's Heart and The Elder in his Unstable phase can no longer be slowed below their base speed. <em>This was causing issues with animations playing out of sync with their actions. </em></li><li>Piety now deals 33% less damage with her Melee attack in Belly of the Beast. Her Cleave damage has been increased slightly.</li><li>Adjusted the cooldown on the Grazing Taurus sunder-esque skill. It is now considered an attack, rather than a spell, for mitigation purposes. </li><li>Bameth, Shifting Darkness now better signals when he is using his Vaal Detonate Dead skill. This skill now radiates outwards for a set distance, rather than along all corpses connected to his target.</li><li>Mongrels (found in Act 8) can now be desecrated. They have also been renamed to Ruin Hellions.</li><li>The following monsters have had their base life significantly increased: Chaos Golem, Arctic Golem, Ice Golem, Lesser Flame Golem, Lesser Ice Golem and Unearthly Skeleton.</li><li>Dominus and his map variants are now less likely to skip their audio cues for Touch of God and Light of Divinity.</li></ul><br>
<strong>The Elder Enounter Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>Zana now appears to provide protection much closer to The Elder upon defeating it. It should be much harder to miss her now. Her dialogue is now shown in the chat window.</li><li>The Portal phase is now significantly shorter but more difficult, spawning more minions in a shorter period of time and using more skills. The minions spawned during this phase target the Shaper more aggressively.</li><li>The Elder's Unstable phase is now more difficult, and can drop more Elder items if successfully completed. This is now the only way to obtain the Watcher's Eye unique jewel.</li><li>The Elder's Expanding Circles during his Unstable phase now deal the same amount of damage as the ones in the earlier phase of the fight. This was an oversight. As a result, this skill deals 70% more damage than previously during the Unstable phase.</li><li>The Elder's growing "Doom Circle" ability is now removed when Zana appears.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Map and Atlas Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>There is now a limit to the number of Sextants you can apply to your Atlas. The base maximum is 1, but this limit is increased by completing bonus objectives and Zana's quests, up to an absolute maximum of 5. Adding Sextants above this limit removes the oldest one. Existing Atlases will keep their Sextants, though applying new Sextants will still remove the oldest one. You can see which Map has the oldest Sextant by hovering over the new Sextant display on your Atlas.</li><li>You are now twice as likely to obtain maps you have not yet completed on the Atlas as maps you have. <em>This is intended to help players who choose to play solo complete their Atlas.</em></li><li>Made changes to how map selection occurs when choosing which maps contain The Elder and his Guardians. As a result of this change, it will be easier on average to encounter The Elder on higher tier maps.</li><li>Maps that contain The Elder no longer contain additional monsters or provide Elder rare items from monsters other than The Elder.</li><li>The change in how monster rarity affects damage increases (see above) has resulted in changes to the Savage and Overlord's map prefixes, as well as the Death and Taxes map mods. These changes can be obained on existing items by using a Divine Orb.</li><li>Many maps have undergone monster density changes to bring them closer in-line with each other.</li><li>The Shaper's Ultimate Chaos (bullet hell) skill now deals 70% less damage to minions.</li><li>The boss in the Death and Taxes unique map deals less damage with its melee attack, and should be significantly less likely to one-shot you after transforming.</li><li>The treasure piles in the Vault map boss encounter, and the boss itself, now drop fewer items. The boss will also use skills that consume treasure piles slightly more often. On average, a Vault boss run should now drop a quantity of items similar to other maps of the same tier, whereas previously it was significantly more.</li><li>Puruna, the Challenger now signals when it is casting a skill more clearly.</li><li>The Enslaver's Slam ability now deals more Physical Damage relative to Fire Damage, and always applies Ignite.</li><li>The boss encounter in the Desert Spring map now has two unique scorpion enemies during the pursuit phase of the encounter. This phase also now has amphoras for players to bust open. Defeating the boss now enables portals into and out of the boss room.</li><li>Improved the layouts of the Scriptorium and Excavation maps. There should be fewer dead ends and empty spaces now.</li><li>The Armoury map is now more linear, and should contain fewer dead ends as well.</li><li>Moved monsters a little further away from the entry point of the Lookouts map.</li><li>Decreased the size of the Barrows map.</li><li>The Vessel of the Vaal sub-bosses in the Atziri areas can no longer submerge immediately upon activating unless you are very far away.</li><li>The Orchard map boss room has been redesigned and now has Labyrinth traps in it, which the Vision of Justice will try to teleport you onto.</li><li>The Orchard and Plaza map bosses now disable all the traps in their rooms when they die. Their magic packs have been moved to outside the boss room.</li><li>Grandmasters in the Hall of Grandmasters now generate 2 Vaal Souls per second, up from 1 soul per 5 seconds.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Passive Skill Tree Balance</strong><hr><ul><li>The Acrobatics Keystone now grants 30% less Energy Shield, down from 50% less Energy Shield. <em>This is to better enable hybrid Energy Shield/Evasion characters, for whom Acrobatics should be a valid choice.</em></li><li>Passive skills which increase Physical Damage dealt by Staves or Wands, or Damage dealt by Wands, now also increase the damage of Ailments caused by those weapons as well. <em>This brings them in line with all the other weapon passives.</em></li></ul><br>
<strong>Ascendancy Rebalance</strong><hr><ul><li>All 19 Ascendancies have been reviewed and undergone extensive changes. As a result of these changes, many existing Ascendancy <em>and</em> Passive Skill trees will be reset.</li></ul><br>
<strong>Shadow - Assassin</strong><hr><ul><li>Noxious Strike: No longer grants a chance to cause bleeding, or increased Skill Effect Duration if you've killed a Maimed Enemy Recently.
